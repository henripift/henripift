## Hi there 👋

I'm **Henri**, a student at Lycée La Colinière in Nantes (France).

I **like creating** websites with my imagination. I started by learning **HTML** and **CSS** to create my first website. Then, I started learning **JavaScript** to improve my sites and make them more attractive with new features.

Currently, the languages I practice the most are: **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Python**. I am also learning: **JavaScript**, **PHP**, and **MySQL**.

I'm currently building my **own portfolio**. It's a good way to **track my progress**! *You can find it in my repositories :).*

You can look at my **GitHub** to see which projects I am working on. I love GitHub; it's a **powerful tool to share my projects**!

Fun facts about me:

- I love video games 🎮

- I like football ⚽
