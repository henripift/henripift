## Hi there 👋

I'm **Henri**, a student of the school **Lycée La Colinière** based in **Nantes**.

I like create websites whit my imagination. So I've started with learning **HTML** and **CSS** to create my first website. 
And then I've started learning **Javascript** to improve my websites and to make them more attractive with a lot of features. 

Actually, the langages I've practiced the most are : HTMl, CSS and Python.
And I'm currently learning : Javascript, PHP and MySQL.

I'm currently my own **portfolio**, it's a good way to follow my **progression** !
*You can find it in my repositories :).*

You can look at my **github** to see which projects I am working on. 
I love **github** it's a powerful tool to share my projects !

**Fun facts abouts me :**
  - I love video games
  - I like football
